# Race_Game
This was one of my project while studying computer science at Queensland University of Technology, it was an early python project that uses randomly generated data for a race game where there are two competitors on a rectangle grid. The goal was to get a random set of data that contained the energy level (how many times a competitor can move) along with what moves they can do (up, down, right) and whoever gets to the right hand side of the grid first wins.


I have drawn the two characters (Mordecai & Rigby) inside the main python file and coded the functions to follow the game's rule from the randomly generated dataset.


Each time the program is run, it will use a new randomly generated dataset so the race will have differing results everytime.
